# Plan

1. **How will you coordinate your work?**
	* Who will coordinate the work?
		1. Calvin Chen - Project Manager
		2. Our project manager will be the one who will coordinate the overall work. The project manager will break down the work into components and distribute them through back-end/front-end skills. Also, we will discuss to determine if the amount of work is digestible and figure out a contingency plan in the case where the deadline date isn’t met. 
	* What will their project management practices be?
		1. Communication with all of the team members
		2. Contingency - Risk Response
		3. Project Planning - Distributes who works on what 
		4. Documentation of building software - create project milestones 
		5. Tracking and Reporting Progress
	* Will conduct use daily or weekly meetings?
		1. The team proposes to have all group, weekly meetings/calls every Tuesday and Thursday afternoons
		2. There will be additional meetings on Monday’s
		3. During this time(Tuesdays/Thursdays), we’ll have stand-ups to see progress amongst the team. Project Manager should keep a record of progress.
	* What will the agendas of meetings be?
		1. Our agenda will consist of an Agile Development Style Meeting
			- Having a roundtable discussing:
				- What was the person working on last time(previous meeting)
				- What are the components that they are currently working on
				- What are the components that the person is going to do next
				- What are the components that they haven’t done - (haven’t been completed in time) - If some components are not finished within the expected timeframe because of personal reasons, then discuss with the project manager and distribute the work that deems the best fit with the other person. 
				- What are some blockers/complications if any that is preventing the person from finishing their work
		2. Because assignments are due on Tuesdays before class, a meeting will be held before that to finalize our assignment details and assess if the goals we implemented are on track. Work will be distributed accordingly if there are any blockers/complications addressed in the meeting
		3. If there are any complications that are hindering our work, meetings will be held via Slack audio meeting will be held somewhat immediately if our group cannot physically make it. These meetings will be held later in the evening because that is when a majority of our group is free during that time. 
2. **What tools will you use to communicate?**

	* For each, articulate the alternatives and why that is the best choice.
		- We will use Slack as our main tool of communication. Slack is convenient and easy to share code.
		- We will communicate whenever someone is confused and needs help, verification (see below)  
		- If a person in our group is MIA there will be a contingency: an overview a person being MIA(Missing in Action)
			- Project Manager will check-up on the tasks
			- If the tasks are approaching the deadline and cannot reach the person after realizing they’re off the grid
			- Notify the rest of the group and also inform the professor to organize a meeting to re-assign work
			- Discuss the work they are currently working on and their future work
			- A request of who should the work then be directed to 
		- If a person in our group is SICK there will be a contingency: an overview a person being SICK
			- Communication with the team via our communication channels from sick person
			- PM to organize  a brief meeting of the work they’re working on
			- Request who should the work then be directed to
			- Request the person to stay in touch
			- Request the sick person to transfer the knowledge on how to do the work they’re doing
			- Inform Professors that person is sick and just not slacking
		- If there are bugs that needs to be taken care of there will be a process:
			a. A person with the bug will request assistance from the other team members
			b. A person with the bug have choices to fix it:
				- Person will handle the overall bug meaning that they’ll research and work on it provided the knowledge from other teammates
				- Have multiple people work on it
				- Ask for outside help via friends/professors/any other resources
3. **Who will own components in your architecture?**
	* Owning them means being responsible for writing them and making sure they are functional and correct.
		- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MWctJIVicAaHCjoEO9CI-hn3R7SYuk683G629gahoIc/edit?usp=sharing
	* For each component, list the one person who is in charge of getting it done.

4. **What is your timeline?**
	* Include a list of milestones you'll reach and deadlines for each.
		1. Milestones will consist of the components that will need to be built to get the product in production with each component requiring a due date. 
		2. The timeline will be provided via a link - (INSERT LINK HERE). Each person will need to color in their tasks once they’re finished
			- Will include Project Title, Who’s working on what, Date that needs to be finished
			- Highlight things in green that are finished
			- Highlight things in yellow that are in progress
			- Highlight things in red that need to be assisted with
		3. This is where the PM looks at projects and determine if milestones are not met
