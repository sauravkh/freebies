Problem Statement:

Students, especially Freshmen upon coming to UW, are unaware of the free resources that the campus provides that are available to them. It is to reduce additional cost for students who are living in a frugal fashion to maintain their financial budgets. To get the most out of college life, resources that do not require additional money spending should be taken advantage of because of the debt that students are already with(tuition). Taking advantage of these resources will save them a lot of money and give them a head start on their education at UW. In short, the purpose of our mission is to help students navigate all the resources that UW campus has to offer.

##User Feedback: (from Jimmy’s interview)

From the user that we have interviewed which we will named Mark (omitting the name of the interviewee due to privacy reason), he is a third-year student who majors in Biology. The interview was conducted in Odegaard Library for 20 minutes. The idea of the project seems very interesting to him. The design of the website is very simple that he can navigate through it. Thanks to him, we also get out of some very interesting feedback. For one, the add button on our site originally only include a plus button with no “Add” word on it. He thinks that it was quite confusing for what purpose is this button do. So, our team decide to include to the word “Add” to give it some context. Moreover, he advises us to add more feature that can improve interaction with users more like notifying the users if a new post is added. He also hopes that we can add filter feature base on time beside key words on the search function. One more interesting perspective that we got from the interview is that we should have a marketing plan in place to make sure the website a success if we decide to launch it, like how would we advertise to students for example.

##Our thought:

we really appreciate the inputs from Mark. He gives us some good suggestions. But, for the time being, we will only focus on the tasks which were prescribed on the design. We would not add more features like notification because it would make our project too big to be accomplices for the time being. We also will not worry about marketing the product website for now. Instead, we hope to create the minimum functioning website that can be used true to our design. If we have more time at the end of the quarter, we will continue to improve the product further. This decision is because we have little time to explore all possibilities; meeting the deadline is a constraint we must follow.
