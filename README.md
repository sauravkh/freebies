Mission Statement: One stop shop for the best locations to rest/study on campus!

Problem Statement:

As we all know, classes in UW can be very stressful for students. School work and personal responsibilities can be overwhelming for students specially freshman who just start in UW. Therefore, finding a good location in UW for relaxation can be a challenge for students. The wellbeing of the student is also the primary goal of school. But how can we find the best place that fit students need? There are many resources in UW that are suitable for helping students getting better life. But it seems that there is no resource that point students to right location that can help them study better maintain their wellbeing.
