Mission Statement: One stop shop for the best locations to rest/study on campus!

Problem Statement:

As we all know, classes in UW can be very stressful for students. Different workloads determine how long you will study for.  School work and personal responsibilities can be overwhelming for students, especially for freshmans who are not familiar with the college lifestyle. Therefore, finding a good location in UW for relaxation can be a challenge for students. What is worst than studying at a loud area? Therefore, studying effeciently and optimizing time in quiet areas can improve the quality of study for a student. But how can we find the best place that fit students need? There are many resources in UW that are suitable for assiting a students well being. However, resources in regards to finding the best location to study does not point students to right location that can help them study better maintain their wellbeing.
