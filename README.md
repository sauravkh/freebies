## Mission Statement

Our mission is to help students take advantage of the free resources that the UW campus provides.

## Problem Statement

Students, especially Freshmen upon coming to UW, are unaware of the free resources that the campus provides that are available to them. It is to reduce additional cost for students who are living in a frugal fashion to maintain their financial budgets. To get the most out of college life, resources that do not require additional money spending should be taken advantage of because of the debt that students are already with(tuition). Taking advantage of these resources will save them a lot of money and give them a head start on their education at UW. In short, the purpose of our mission is to help students navigate all the resources that UW campus has to offer.
